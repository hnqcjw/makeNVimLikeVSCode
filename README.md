# makeNVimLikeVSCode

This just, as the title says, makes NVim Like VS Code!

This adds

- Syntax Highlighting
- Sets tabstop to 4
- Enables mouse
- And adds auto complete (Somewhat, for example, it adds a ) when you type a (, a } when you type a {, etc)

### Hope you Enjoy it, and good luck with Neovim!
